# Interactive AI Model Constructor

An interactive framework for building, optimizing and evaluating classic machine-learning pipelines with support for multimodal tasks. This repository provides tools for hyperparameter optimization, experiment tracking, and stores precomputed results for regression and classification benchmarks.

## Features

- **Interactive Pipeline Builder**  
  Define and assemble data-processing and model-training steps using a simple, extensible interface.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)**  
  - Grid Search  
  - Random Search  
  - Bayesian Optimization  
  - Evolutionary Algorithms  

- **Experiment Tracking**  
  Automatic logging of model configurations, performance metrics (CV MSE, CV Accuracy, test scores) and run durations.

- **Benchmark Results**  
  Precomputed outputs for:
  - **Regression** (California Housing dataset)  
  - **Classification** (Wine Quality dataset)
