# Hyperparameter Optimization Algorithm Comparison

This repository contains a systematic comparison of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms applied to both regression and classification tasks.

## Highlights

- **Algorithms Evaluated**  
  - Grid Search  
  - Random Search  
  - Bayesian Optimization  
  - Evolutionary Strategies  

- **Tasks**  
  - Regression (e.g., California Housing)  
  - Classification (e.g., Wine Quality)  

- **Experiment Tracking**  
  Automatic logging of hyperparameter configurations, cross-validation metrics, test performance, and runtime statistics.

- **Precomputed Results**  
  Ready-to-inspect outputs for model performance and comparison charts.
